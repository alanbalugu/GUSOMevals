INSTRUCTIONS

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK....IT MAY NOT WORK AND IT MIGHT MESS THINGS UP.
**ALSO on a MAC, you have to run chromedriver once before running any script so that it isn't blocked by the security. Like double-click the chromedriver executable.

1. Install Python
2. Install Google Chrome if you don't already have it
2. Check version of chrome and download the correct “chromedriver” version
(https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
3. Install the “selenium” python module using either pip or conda based on your python install
(ex. pip install selenium)
(might need to install Pip package manager first if you don't have it already)
4. Edit the script with the following (search for “ *** ” to find these lines):
	1. Filepath / location of chromedriver on your computer
	2. Your netID and password
	3. The last 9 digits of the long id number on the back of your gocard
5. Run the python script and just let it do its thing for a while.
